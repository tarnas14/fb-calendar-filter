# fb-calendar-filter
An application for getting a filtered facebook calendar to synchronize it with your google calendar! 

I just didn't want to see suggested facebook events in my google calendar, I found https://github.com/simonbengtsson/eventcal/ and decided to do something just like that.

the app is online on heroku: https://fb-googlecal-filter.herokuapp.com/
